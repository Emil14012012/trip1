    <h1>Places i think i'll like in dubai</h1>
    <h2>1)Burj Khalifa</h2>
    <ul>
        <p class="ratings">4.5 star rating</p>
        <p>Standing 828m high, Burj Khalifa
            is the tallest building in the world
            and one of Dubai's must-visit attractions.
            The majestic skyscraper is located in the
            heart of the city and is a hub of activity
            day and night. Just looking up in awe at
            its sheer scale is memorable in itself,
            but it's definitely worth venturing inside
            too. You can capture perfect views of the city
            from the observation deck at levels 124 and 125,
            or have a bite to eat in the At The Top Sky Lounge.
            For special occasions, treat yourself to a sunset
            session at The Lounge, Burj Khalifa, the highest
            lounge in the world at 585m.</p>
        <p>Opening hours - At The Top: 8am to 12am daily</p>
        <p>Price - At The Top: From AED380</p>
        <P class="good">positive reviews</P>
        <p>I)We booked the VIP ticket for the Sundown
            - We booked the VIP ticket for the Sundown
            - Super organization - recommend booking
            in advance. 125 floors without noticing
            in 60 seconds then off to the 148th -
            what a view - downside - pictures are
            taken on the top - tip: look closely
            at the pictures, my feet are missing
            - then ask for the prices -
            if you want online access you'll quickly
            be at 75€ per picture so look closely!!!</p>
        <p>II)The 125th floor was sold out so we bought
            tickets to the 148th floor. It was very
            overpriced and some staff on the floor were
            rude. Sunset was nice although the smog reduces
            visibility so not the best view I have seen from
            very tall buildings.</p>
        <p class="bad">negative reviews</p>
        <p>I)Extremely long waiting lines, hence waiting time.
            It took us at least 1,5 hours from the attraction’s
            entrance to the viewpoint on the 124th floor.
            There are only two elevators that will take the
            guests to the 124th floor. The elevators’ capacity
            is exceeded (signal is being ignored by the staff)
            just to speed up the process of getting the guests
            to the 124th floor as soon as possible.
            The view is very disappointing, because the viewpoint
            is much higher than the other buildings in the area,
            hence if you want to take pictures the angle is such
            that your legs are mirrored in the glass window.
            Furthermore the windows are dirty, so clear views
            for photo purposes are impossible.The waiting line
            and waiting time to get back to the ground floor
            are also horrible (at least 30 minutes).Nevertheless
            if you do want to visit the Burj Khalifa, buy a
            fast track ticket. If you want to see the
            sunset from the 124th floor, you pay double
            price. Prices vary by time slot. Be aware that
            if you have tickets to see the sunset, there is a
            good chance you’ll miss it due to the long waiting
            lines.</p>
        <p>II)It’s hard to believe anyone would give this 5 stars
            unless they paid to avoid the queues. Paying for a
            specific time (ie sunset) seems like a racket. The
            queue is interminable, with nowhere to sit, no air
            conditioning, nowhere to get a drink of water, and only a
            few hidden toilets. Young children crying because it
            really isn’t suitable for them. While we were queuing
            I decided to read some reviews and saw one that described
            these hellish queues and also mentioned that it was worse
            at the top and even adults were crying at that point. I
            started to feel quite panicky and claustrophobic.
            Not because of the conditions alone, more because it
            felt like we would not be safe if we had to exit quickly.
            There were very few staff around and no information about
            the queue. Every few minutes a large group of VIPs would
            walk past. We had tickets to a show in the evening so we
            decided to leave and forfeit over £200 rather than miss
            the show (we had left 4.5 hours for the Burj visit).
            Very out of character for us but I’d rather pay that
            to avoid having to wait in those conditions with no
            guarantee of an escape.</p>

        <p>I)Legoland Dubai has nice rides and activities for children
            who love Lego. It is a good idea to check on their website
            which rides are suitable depending on the height of the child
            before going to the park. However as a person in The twenties,
            my personal favourite part of Legoland is the Big Shop with all
            the wonderful Lego sets that most of which can only be found there .
            Many thanks to Tesfa, Ayush, Sylvia and Augustin for helping my family
            and I on 24/01/2025, when we bought so many dream setts. Some of
            which were large so we needed assistance in getting them back to
            the car. I also know Tesfa for more than 7 years and I really
            appreciate his help every time we go when he takes us around the
            shop and shows us the new items. He also try’s his best to find the
            items we are looking for, and sometimes he gets them from other
            shops across the park.The only disadvantage is the expensive
            ticket price. There should be a reduced price for adults or
            residents like when the park first opened in 2016. Unfortunately
            the annual pass is not a good solution for me as I only go 2 or 3 times per year.</p>
        <p>II)Had a blast at Legoland Water Park! Tons of fun slides and attractions. Big shout-out
            to lifeguard Nishanka da Silva who gave me the inside scoop on the best food and
            chill spots during his break. Super helpful and friendly! Highly
            recommend for an awesome day out, even if you're going solo.</p>
        <p class="bad">negative reviews</p>
        <p>I)Impressively low overall quality. I really dont know where
            to begin. I would go so far that i suspect 90% of the google
            reviews are bots. Fake.Impressively low overall quality. I
            really dont know where to begin. I would go so far that i
            suspect 90% of the google reviews are bots. Fake.The rides
            are boring, even for small Extremely non-enthusiastic crew.
            The price is a rip off, because there is actually nothing to
            to in here.People giving this place more than a 2 system
            review must have never been to a theme park. What a waste
            of time in dubai. I would compare it to a walk on the
            dubai marina beach. Equally entertaining. And the marina
            is free.Stay away. Oh and The Lego brand should be ashamed.
            When we visit Lego, we expect quality..This whole place
            seems subsided.The insane part is that the small kids can't
            ride because of insane height restrictions. The most
            boring rides has 120 cm minimum hight restriction.
            No kids laugh. No one screams. No joy.</p>

        <p>I)Best theme park ever I rode almost all the rides and they were amazing 🤩 we had a lot of range of
            snacks and games as well as kid rides for the family🤩</p>

        <p class="bad">negative reviews</p>
        <p>its hard to find bad reviews here, by the way. </p>
        <p>I)Visited over the weekend with family and young kids. Too many teenagers and young adults from school
            trip, very poorly organized. No staff supervision of the queue, so many school trips teens jumping the
            queue and arguing with other visitors who were queuing. Really disappointed</p>
        <p>II)Nice, but lots of rides under maintenance! also the ride collided due to fire alarm and we didn’t get
            to go though we were at the start of the queue!</p>
        <p>III)I bought annual tickets for my kids for motion gates, and the plan to buy regular passes. Going on a
            Sunday, at noon, and temperature around 40. I was not admitted to riverland unless I buy tickets at the
            park entrance where there are only 3 ticket windows, families stay for 15 minutes at least to buy
            tickets, and there is along line! My kids were not permitted to go alone because one of them is 11.
            Question, why did you sell me the annual tickets for kids, if you know you will make suffer everything I
            bring them. Allow me to enter the park as an adult, and let me buy the ticket from motiongate. Or stop
            selling annual passes for kids alone without their parents.</p>
