        <p>I)We visited on 7th march 2025 and had a Fantastic day out. Rode all the rides multiple times. Front row of
            formula rossa is a must!
            We (myself and 17 year old son) also booked the roof top walk before arriving. We was lucky enough to be the
            only 2 on our walk. Srikanth was our guide and he was amazing, full of information and gave some great tips
            on the coasters aswell. At first we declined the photographer but changed our minds last minute and glad we
            did as we bought 3 photos (one with srikanth in it as a memory) couldn't reccomend any higher and definitely
            a day we will talk about in the future.</p>
        <p>II)Amazing time at Ferrari World the Walk on the Roof was a real experience! The pictures Asitha took are
            really amazing! He took pictures when I was not expecting to capture the entire experience! I would
            recommend if you visit to do this! On the roof you will learn alot about Abu Dhabi amd what major even takes
            place there!</p>
        <p>III)This is a must for any F1/Ferrari fan. Lots of Ferrari products for all tastes and budgets, some cool
            rides and the chance to check a little bit of the history behind this successful brand. Going early and
            during weekdays proved to be quite good since it was not crowded at all, so I could enjoy pretty much
            everything without queueing. And yes, Formula Rossa is something everyone should try at least once in their
            lives.</p>
        <p class="bad">negative reviews</p>
        <p>I)Lovely staff and layout just a rip off for children pay admission and they can't go on anything it's big
            con.
            Any children under 4 or under 1.2 metres don't bother, not sure who made the high rules on some of the rides
            must have been an idiot</p>
        <p>II)In my opinion this is over hyped..... queues are so long and didn't appear to be a lot open on the day
            Good to have visited - would I recommend it?? Not sure!</p>

            <p>I)We are Annual Pass Member, we visited Yas WaterWorld with my family it was a great and amazing
                experience! And Jao, gave us a very good information about annual pass member that can bring 3 family

            <p>II)Yas Waterworld is one of the best water parks in the UAE, offering a mix of thrilling rides,
                family-friendly attractions, and unique water experiences. The park is well-maintained, has friendly
                staff, and features standout rides. It’s great for all ages. Perfect for a fun day out, especially in
                summer!</p>

            <p>I)We visited the park with our family on March 11, 2025—two adults and two children, aged 5 and 8. The
                ticket prices are based on height, so we paid the full price for everyone. We purchased the tickets
                directly from the park’s website. Once we arrived, most of the attractions were closed, including the
                pearl dive the kids' area, surfing, ball activities, etc. There weren’t many visitors, so there was no
                need to wait in line. However, there wasn’t much for our youngest child to enjoy since the big slides
                were too intense for a 5-year-old at 111 cm, and the area for smaller kids didn’t offer much in terms of
                value. Our older child had been looking forward to the pearl dive and surfing, but was also
                disappointed. The large slides were too intense for an 8-year-old as well, and having to carry the tubes
                and mats up numerous stairs by themselves was not worth the price. We spoke with the staff, but they
                seemed indifferent. They claimed all the information about closures was available on the website, though
                even the staff couldn’t find the notices about most attractions being shut down. We did receive a
                refund, but had we known in advance, we wouldn’t have gone. The whole experience left a bad impression.
            </p>
            <p>there are no more bad reviews, the place is great.</p>
